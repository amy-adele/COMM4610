<p>Please listen to this 6-minute audio lecture:<a id="media_comment_m-5XmvxcGBqV3Wh7p3pVQbm2gLPqxvceKo" class="instructure_inline_media_comment audio_comment" href="%24IMS-CC-FILEBASE%24/media_objects/m-5XmvxcGBqV3Wh7p3pVQbm2gLPqxvceKo.flv"></a><img style="float: left; padding: 10px;" src="%24IMS-CC-FILEBASE%24/circle%20icons/magicwand.png" alt="magicwand.png" width="128" height="128"></p>
<p>You may have heard the statement "gender is socially constructed." This means that many of the things we assume are natural and fixed about gender are in fact social norms that are specific to particular communities, social-economic classes, cultures, and time periods. Just think about how different the ideal of beauty for a woman is in the US today versus the 1920's or as compared to Italy during the Renaissance or contemporary urban Nigeria. Everything, including body type, clothing, speech, and mannerisms, is somewhat different.</p>
<h3>Sex vs. Gender</h3>
<p>In the Genderbread diagram below, note that "sex" refers to sex organs. Gender, on the other hand is more complex. It is a combination of your gender identity (how you feel about yourself) and your gender expression (how you dress, act, and interact). In other words, your gender expression is how you communicate (intentionally or not) your identity to other people. Gender can also be considered a <a href="http://www.theory.org.uk/ctr-butl.htm">performance</a>, conscious or not, that we do according to social norms, rules, and scripts. Next time you are on public transit, pay attention to how much space men take up as compared to women--how much of that is physical and biological and how much is cultural?</p>
<p>Recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>sex (<a id="" class="" title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_characteristics" target="">sexual characteristics</a>) is biological</li>
<li>gender is cultural and communicative</li>
</ul>
<p>When a person's gender identity and expression don't align with the social expectations for their biological sex, this person is <strong><a id="" class="" title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender" target="">transgender</a></strong>. If those things do align with the social expectations, this person is <strong><a id="" class="" title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender" target="">cisgender</a></strong>. For example, a person born with female sex organs who identifies as a woman and expresses a feminine gender presentation is known as cisgender, though a lot of people have never heard this word because it describes a social norm that many people don't usually think about. A person assigned female at birth who later decides to present and identify as a man will probably say they are transgender, and some people also call that FtM (female to male). A person who was assigned female at birth who later identifies or expresses their gender as androgynous or genderqueer may or may not call themselves transgender.</p>
<h3>Gender and sex continuums rather than binaries</h3>
<p>We often rely on only two terms, "male" and "female," to describe gender. As this diagram illustrates, for any given person, it is often far more complex. In other words, we often see the world in binaries, but the reality is usually a spectrum of variation and complexity. For a more detailed explanation, read this short article about the "<a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/11/breaking-through-the-binary-gender-explained-using-continuums/">genderbread person</a>."</p>
<p><img src="%24IMS-CC-FILEBASE%24/Genderbread-Person-3.3.jpg" alt="Genderbread-Person-3.3.jpg"></p>
<p>The complexity also does not stop at the wide variety of culturally constructed expressions of gender. It turns out that biological sex is also not as simple as XX and XY. You'll read more about this concept in the assigned article "<a href="http://www.autostraddle.com/claudia-is-intersex-lets-talk-about-it-149137/">Claudia is Intersex, Let’s Talk About It.</a>" While humans like to categorize things and put them into neat boxes with clear labels, our natural and social worlds are full of shades of gray.</p>
<h3>Biology vs. culture</h3>
<p>There is very little definitive scientific proof for many (though not all) of the gender differences people think are biological. Of the differences that do exist, we tend to greatly exaggerate their importance. <span style="font-size: 14px;">Researchers like </span><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sexing-Body-Politics-Construction-Sexuality/dp/0465077145/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z">Anne Fausto-Sterling</a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> and </span><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Delusions-Gender-Society-Neurosexism-Difference/dp/0393340244">Cordelia Fine </a><span style="font-size: 14px;">point out that studies that claim there is a biological origin for social, psychological, and behavioral gender differences are often sensationalized or even falsely reported in the press.</span></p>
<p>You've probably heard the insult "you throw like a girl." People think that it's a biological difference that men can throw a ball faster and farther than women. However, some clever experiments demonstrate that any differences in average performance are in fact due to practice and training.</p>
<p><a id="" class="" title="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD5Xm5u7UDM">Mythbusters has a segment on this!</a></p>
<p>The brain studies that claim to find psychological gender differences get a lot of attention in the press too, but they are especially flawed--there's no way to know if women, for example, show more brain activity for empathy than men because of some inherent biological difference or because they've been encouraged their whole lives to be empathetic.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; padding: 15px;" src="http://www.scilogs.eu/en/gallery/11/sex-on-brain.jpg" alt="Pink and blue painted brains illustration" width="355" height="306">Of course there are some biological differences between men and women, but most of the ones that hold up to scientific scrutiny are physical differences. In addition to sex organs, there's a reliable but small difference in average waist-to-hip ratios, arm circumferences, height, etc. But it gets a lot more complicated for all those supposed psychological differences, like that men are better at math and spatial reasoning and women are better with language and emotions:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, the differences are often smaller than we think. One <a href="http://www.psych.rochester.edu/people/reis_harry/assets/pdf/CarothersReis_2012.pdf">meta-analysis </a>shows that even when there are differences, the averages are so close and the variation so wide that it makes no sense to assume that any given behavior difference between two people is attributable to gender.</li>
<li>Second, when we find differences in psychology or brain function, we really have no way of knowing if the differences we see are the result of fixed biological differences or of differences in experience and culture. Correlation is not causation! Our brains are very plastic and constantly change according to our experiences. Thus the very same thing--social norms about gender--could be causing both the brain difference and the behavior difference at the same time!</li>
</ul>
<p>Next time you hear someone assert that men and women are inherently and biologically different in some way, ask yourself: Is there any way a study could prove that this trait is caused by a biological sex difference and not caused by culture and simply correlated to biological sex? If you're interested, check <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> and see if it's been studied. But keep your critical hat on: Does the study distinguish correlation from causation?</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about this issue is that despite a lack of solid evidence, people still prefer to assume that social, psychological, and behavioral gender differences are biological. Why do you think that is?</p>
<h3><span>Why does this matter?</span></h3>
<p><img style="float: right; padding: 10px;" src="%24IMS-CC-FILEBASE%24/let%20your%20son%20play%20with%20dolls%20arent%20you%20afriad%20he%20will%20become%20a%20good%20father.png" alt="let your son play with dolls arent you afriad he will become a good father.png" width="282" height="472">The fact that gender is culturally constructed is not a problem in and of itself. But many people believe that these constructions are harmful to all people because they are hierarchical (one is seen as better than the other) and thus are at the root of local and global inequalities between men and women. </p>
<p>Take a look at this list and spend a minute thinking about this question: Is each characteristic on the “masculine” side of each pair seen as more, less, or equally valuable than the characteristic on the “feminine” side?</p>

<p>For many people, a lot of the characteristics on the "feminine" side have negative connotations. This creates barriers and limitations for both men and women.</p>
<p>While women have formal, legal equality to men in the US, there are still many ways in which men and women are not equal. Here are some examples, but see if you can think of more:</p>
<ul>
<li>on average, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/the-pay-gap-is-because-of-gender-not-jobs.html?_r=0">men are paid more than women</a>
</li>
<li>on average, <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2011/112304_1.html">women do more housework and child care labor than men</a>, even when both partners work full-time</li>
<li>most rapists are men and most (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/health/as-victims-men-struggle-for-rape-awareness.html?pagewanted=all">though certainly not all</a>) <a href="https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims">victims are women</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people believe that most, or even all, gender inequalities like these are natural and inevitable because they are rooted in biology. However, it's important to think critically about the evidence for these beliefs.</p>
<p>At the same time, saying that a gender difference is caused by culture does not mean it's easy to change. Many gender inequalities are very entrenched and difficult to change, but understanding the role of cultural constructions in how we think about gender is a first step.</p>
